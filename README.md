This repository contains a jupyter collab notebook that was used to create  a datacube from the following datasets (Sentinel-1 VV and VH Sentinel-2 NDVI Temperature LST data from (MODIS) Data Elevation  from (SRTM)
Data was extracted from Google earth enginge using the following links; 
S1 polarization mode  extraction-https://code.earthengine.google.com/e90ce6acc16c7b216527b168f450aabb
S2 NDVI Extraction- https://code.earthengine.google.com/b94fd8f4f49012ffacd0195cea4656b5
